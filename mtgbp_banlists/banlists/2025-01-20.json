            "Lutri, the Spellchaser": "The Companion condition is close to nothing in a format where singleton is king- you only need to play a deck with a color identity containing at least blue and red! Some commander where played over some other only for this benefit. As it does not push the format in a more diverse environment, it is thus banned.",
            "Mox Amber": "This card is also closely related to the structure of the format: having a low cost commander helps casting it over and over. This is the essence of the benefits a player gets from playing Mox Amber. Moreover, have a zero-cost mana source that is not a land helps moving forward and faster in the game. Finaly, this is a combo piece with some commanders. Mox Amber is now banned."
